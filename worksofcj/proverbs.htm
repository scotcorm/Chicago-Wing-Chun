	Wing Chun Kuen Kuit are Words of Wisdom which capture in poetic terms the
	finer attributes of Wing Chun martial arts. The term Kuen Kuit is Cantonese
	for martial sayings or fighting songs. Chinese martial arts employ Kuen Kuit
	as concise, rhythmic verses which preserve a unique fighting method or philosophy
	of a style. Even among competing Wing Chun traditions, many sayings are
	recognized and shared. One &nbsp;proverb cites, "Loy Lau Hoi Sung, Lut Sau
	Jik Chung." This means: "Retain what's coming in, send off what's retreating;
	Rush in upon loss of hand contact." Regardless of the Wing Chun tradition,
	this advice bridges many differences and defines one of the most important
	strategies of the art.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Wing Chun proverbs have been reaching the public for years due to the efforts
	of masters' Moy Yat, Wang Kiu, Augustine Fong and others. The original Kuen
	Kuit are believed to descend from an ancient, oral tradition, and reportedly
	were connected to southern Chinese secret societies or boxers of the nineteenth
	century. Moy Yat wrote, "It was during the Ch'ing dynasty that many of the
	proverbs were part of secret codes and rituals developed by the rebels dedicated
	to overthrowing the Manchus." Over the years, unrelated or inapplicable sayings
	were discarded; the remaining few are described as being "truly intrinsic"
	to Wing Chun Kuen.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	"Wing Chun Chuen Jing Tung" is a proverb usually displayed in the traditional
	Wing Chun school. This refers to the genuineness of the martial art and reads,
	"Wing Chun authentically passing down." This indicates&nbsp;passing on the
	true system of Wing Chun "unchanged by your own
	ideas."<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>3</SUP></FONT> Other well known proverbs record:
	&nbsp;"Kuen Yau Sum Faat" (The punch starts from the heart); "Ying Da Juck
	Da, But Ying Da, But Ho Da..." (Strike when you should, Do not strike when
	you should not...); "Chew Ying Joi Ying" (Face toward and chase the opponent);
	"Chum Jong Sau Jone" (Sink the elbow, protect the
	center),<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>4</SUP></FONT> and "Guan Mo Leung Heung" (The
	staff doesn't make two sounds), etc.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In the following pages the quantity of proverbs recorded is fascinating.
	Wing Chun's Traditional Rules of Conduct and the popular sayings will be
	easily recognized. Others have been preserved based upon the discretion of
	sifu Augustine Fong. &nbsp;There are maxims, training proverbs and sayings
	for all the Wing Chun forms. The majority of these are poetic commentaries
	on Wing Chun boxing. Some verses appear similar to the training proverbs
	preserved in the Chinese Internal Arts. For instance, "People do not know
	the extent of my skills, but I know their abilities," is attributed to Yang
	Lew-Shan: "The theory of Tai-Chi is that nobody knows you, only you know
	them."<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>5</SUP></FONT> This is a popular saying, as are
	those which mention invisible techniques such as the famed Mo Ying Gerk (No
	Shadow kick).
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While masters of self-defense declare that real experience is the best teacher,
	Wing Chun proverbs excel as wonderful reminders and clues to the mastery
	of this martial art. These poetic stanzas preserve a secret martial arts
	tradition, and a legacy which can be rendered in beautiful Chinese calligraphy.
	Wing Chun Kuen Kuit are treasures waiting to be discovered. These verses
	remain an outstanding contribution to the world of Chinese martial arts.

	Retain what's coming in, send off what is retreating. <BR>
	Rush in upon loss of hand contact. <BR>
	Do not be lax when your opponent is not advancing. <BR>
	Once your opponent moves, his center of gravity changes. <BR>
	Make the first move to have control. Attack according to timing. <BR>
	Timing is achieved through practice. <BR>
	A strong attitude and posture gives an advantage over your opponent. <BR>
	Being alert and adapting to the situation allows maximum results for minimum
	effort. <BR>
	The body follows the movement of the hands. The waist and the stance move
	together. <BR>
	Complement the hands with posture to make good use of the centerline. <BR>
	The eyes and the mind travel together, paying attention to leading edge of
	attack. <BR>
	Charge into the opponent. Execute three moves together. <BR>
	Strike any presented posture if it is there. Otherwise strike where you see
	motion. <BR>
	Beware of sneak attacks, leakage attacks and invisible centerline attacks.
	<BR>
	Soft and relaxed strength will put your opponent in jeopardy. <BR>
	Coordinate the hands and feet. Movement is together. <BR>
	Do not take risks and you will always connect to the target. <BR>
	Have confidence and your calmness will dominate the situation. <BR>
	Occupy the inner gate to strike deep into the defense. <BR>
	To win in an instant is a superior achievement. <BR>
	The Yin Yang principle should be thoroughly understood. <BR>
	The theory of Wing Chun has no limit in it applications. <BR>
	Be humble to request your teacher for guidance. <BR>
	Understand the principles for your training. <BR>
	Upon achieving the highest level of proficiency, <BR>
	The application of techniques will vary according to the opponent.

	There are not many sets of training exercises in Wing Chun. <BR>
	They are easy to learn but to master them requires determination. <BR>
	Learning the usual ways will allow later variations. <BR>
	Short arm bridges and fast steps requires practicing the stance first. <BR>
	Siu Lim Tau mainly trains internal power. <BR>
	Lon Sau in Chum Kiu is a forceful technique. <BR>
	Bui Jee contains life saving emergency techniques. <BR>
	The Wooden Man develops use of power. <BR>
	Fancy techniques should not be used in sticky hand practice. <BR>
	Sticky leg practice is inseparable from single leg stance. <BR>
	The steps follow turning of the body like a cat. <BR>
	The posture complements the hands to eject the opponent. <BR>
	The Six and a Half Point Staff does not make more than one sound. <BR>
	The Eight Cut Sword techniques have no match. <BR>
	The thrusting and fast attacks are well suited for closing in. <BR>
	Eyes beaming with courage can neutralize the situation. <BR>
	Unknown techniques are not suitable for training practice. <BR>
	Those who completely master the system are among the very few.
