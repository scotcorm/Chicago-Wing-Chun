	The essentials of Wing Chun Kuen are preserved through its first training
	set known as Siu Lim Tau. Siu Lim Tau is best translated as "Small Idea."
	&nbsp;It signifies a humble beginning and is designed to guide one in the
	right direction from the outset of training. The introduction of the combat
	orientated exercise Sticky Hands (Chi Sau) and remaining hand sets--Searching
	for the Bridge (Chum Kiu) and Shooting Fingers (Biu Jee)--direct the Wing
	Chun student to advanced levels of proficiency. The mastery of Wooden Dummy
	techniques and Wing Chun Weapons represents completion.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Wing Chun's three hand sets describe a textbook for the complete system of
	Wing Chun Kuen. Some modern instructors may regard forms practice with suspicion,
	but these routines are beneficial in a many ways. &nbsp;A set or routine
	represents a time capsule for future generations. Since ancient times, special
	schools have maintained systems of movement to preserve and transmit important
	knowledge. &nbsp;Moving meditation and sacred postures or gymnastics are
	common to many disciplines of the Far East. Such exercises promote a complete
	and harmonious development in man. Martial arts also function in this capacity,
	especially those connected with Chinese religious and philosophical traditions.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	As a beginning set, Siu Lim Tau demonstrates the initial training phase for
	a pupil by providing a vital infrastructure for Wing Chun boxing. Siu Lim
	Tau motions are designed primarily as fundamentals of techniques. &nbsp;However
	many of its movements are immediately useful and practical. It is understood
	all the Wing Chun "seed" concepts are discovered in the confines of this
	subtle routine. Through the mastery of Siu Lim Tau the remainder of Wing
	Chun skills will follow quickly and naturally. Without a solid, efficient
	base all subsequent forms and techniques will, by association, be established
	on hollow ground.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<IMG SRC="budha1.bmp" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="170" ALIGN="Left">Like many concepts
	in Wing Chun Kuen, the meaning of Siu Lim Tau<I> </I>can be examined on various
	levels. A translation reveals that <I>Siu</I> means Small, Little or Humble.
	&nbsp;<I>Lim</I> (Nim) means to think or remember, also to read or recite
	aloud. This term is associated with many Buddhist phrases such as Prayer
	Beads (Lim Chu), Repeating Prayers (Lim Ching) and Reciting Amida (Lim Fut).
	<I>Tau</I> means Head, Top or Summit. When combined together, <I>Lim Tau</I>
	signifies a thought or idea--this indicates Mind. Siu Lim Tau therefore describes
	a simple intention, a humble thought, a small beginning or even a concise
	religious ideal.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	It has been noted Siu Lim Tau set was once designated Siu <I>Lien</I> Tau
	or Little <I>Training</I> Set. There is evidence to support this opinion.
	&nbsp;Some say Yip Man's genius should be credited for renaming this training
	set Small Idea. &nbsp;If true, this would display Yip Man's grasp of the
	essence and deeper significance behind the martial arts. However, this is
	difficult to ascertain since other Wing Chun lineages, such as Pao Fa Lien
	Wing Chun, also identify their first training set as Little Idea. As a religious
	ideal, Siu Lim Tau is also anticipated in the phrase Saam Bai Fut (Three
	Bows to Buddha)--the name of the Shaolin training set from which Siu Lim
	Tau reportedly descends. These notions and others, if true, may demonstrate
	that Siu Lim Tau's ideology was established early and was a reflection of
	the Shaolin Buddhist tradition.

	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Wing Chun Kuen is said to be more than just a fighting style. According to
	legend, it descended from a Buddhist tradition that possessed great insight
	into all areas of human development. However, the primary aim presented in
	Wing Chun training, and Siu Lim Tau as well, is focused upon self-defense.
	Maxims of Siu Lim Tau state, "There are one hundred and eight moves, all
	practical and real. Thousands of variations can be used, Aiming for practical
	use and not beauty." It should be kept in mind that Wing Chun Kuen and its
	concice, practical training program is essentially combat orientated.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Siu Lim Tau training is the foundation upon which Wing Chun Kuen is based.
	Wing Chun masters regard the Siu Lim Tau set as analogous to an alphabet
	which allows for the construction of key fighting words and sentences. This
	allows one to compose combat orientated works in a free manner without a
	rigid system or even the ideas of others. Training in Siu Lim Tau points
	to mastery of "root" techniques. In this way, the fighter will have the means
	of expressing personal, complete ideas in combat application.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Tsui Sheung Tin wrote that Siu Lim Tau set consists of two parts: Force of
	Idea and Structure. The development and use of correct body structure is
	an important facet of training. Wing Chun's Basic Posture (Yee Jee Kim Yeung
	Ma) develops stability and is designed to focus "energy" towards a specific
	target. &nbsp;It is through the natural contraction of the lower abdominal
	muscles that one's body and legs are encouraged to function as one unit.
	This unity permits the legs to maintain a ready state and allows for generation
	of the "Force of Idea." &nbsp;The basic hand movements--Taan Sau, Bong Sau
	and Fok Sau represent the finest structures created to utilize this
	force!<SMALL>3</SMALL>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	"The Force of Idea," states master Tin, "is simply a concentration of one's
	mind so that every part of the body is filled up with internal strength...
	Siu-Nim-Tau is the guide to the full concentration of the mind. If practised
	properly, one can drive one's internal strength into any part of one's body
	at any time. One is said to have gained the Force of Idea from Siu-Nim-Tau
	if one can maintain concentration of one's mind even if there are rapid moves."
	Siu Lim Tau practice also develops other fine qualities such as spiritual
	clarity or Mind only. It is through the reduction of thoughts and feelings
	that a state of "emptiness" and detachment is achieved. &nbsp;It is said
	when the mind is calm, the body relaxes and the Ch'i (vital force) flows
	naturally. &nbsp;In this way the Force of Idea can be most effectively applied.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Siu Lim Tau directs the martial artist to a humble beginning and therefore
	an essential development. This includes physical, psychological and spiritual
	aspects of life. &nbsp;Regarding the latter, consistent practice of the Small
	Idea encourages the uncovering of the translucent through "Seeing into one's
	own nature."<I> &nbsp;</I>By directly pointing to the Mind and that which
	is real, one acquires Suchness or Awareness--a necessary quality for the
	realization of truth and reality. This essential renewal or purification
	of the Mind remains untouched by ordinary human beings. It is suggested that
	perhaps we are not simple enough.
	<H4 ALIGN=Center>
	  <FONT COLOR="#000000"> <FONT face="Lucida Handwriting">THREE SECTIONS</FONT>
	  </FONT>
	</H4>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Within Siu Lim Tau set, three parts introduce the basic techniques and skills
	utilized in later combinations and other Wing Chun forms. The hand techniques
	learned are used both offensively and defensively. Siu Lim Tau, because of
	its immobile nature, is not generally applicable. Siu Lim Tau skills must
	be combined with Wing Chun footwork and other qualities from advanced sets
	to be truly effective. The Basic Posture (Yee Jee Kim Yeung Ma) is the source
	of all footwork. Here, in Siu Lim Tau, the Basic Posture finds its greatest
	expression. &nbsp;As first form and level in Wing Chun Kuen, Siu Lim Tau
	is considered preliminary. The first practical combat level begins with Wing
	Chun's second form Chum Kiu (Searching for the Bridge).
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<IMG SRC="danny.jpg" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="150" ALIGN="Left">At first glance
	Siu Lim Tau set appears simplistic and even uninvolved. As indicated this
	training routine contains all the seed movements inherent in Wing Chun Kuen.
	&nbsp;Moreover, the basic Posture employed is based on a pyramid and represents
	the Wing Chun principle of fluidity of motion and "economy of energy."
	&nbsp;Hand skills and techniques are based on pyramid or triangular positions
	as well. These facts betray Wing Chun's advanced geometric design and clearly
	demonstrate many improvements and simplifications accomplished in relation
	to the original Shaolin methods.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	When performing Siu Lim Tau, nearly the entire first section is practiced
	very slowly. Here a pupil concentrates on fundamental aspects of the set:
	&nbsp;building up a foundation, technique, patience, mental clarity, etc.
	&nbsp;Also, these slow motions allow one to enhance the function of the
	individual muscles separately. Without using muscular strength, one generates
	the correct, natural amount of tension in the arms and body--neither too
	tight nor loose. The practitioner isolates and develops Ch'i (vitality) through
	natural tension. This method serves to increase the potential energy of the
	individual; it then stores and circulates that energy in a natural, beneficial
	way. Thus, one learns to control his Ch'i and eventually to direct it to
	every part of his body.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Siu Lim Tau's first section introduces three Wing Chun family techniques:
	Taan Sau (Spreading Hand), Bong Sau (Tying Arm), and Fok Sau (Neutral Hand).
	Striking techniques such as the Fist and Palm are also introduced. Correct
	elbow positioning or movement is also acquired. &nbsp;The elbow serves a
	special function in Wing Chun Kuen. Like the knees and hips, the elbow assists
	in generating and directing power used in hand techniques. If the position
	of the elbow is incorrect, other positions are also affected. In most hand
	techniques, the elbow remains down and in--pushing and pulling. Correct elbow
	movement is vital for developing a powerful yet economical punch. &nbsp;It
	also assists in the maintenance of a better defensive line. Siu Lim Tau practice
	is instrumental in strengthening firm, structural techniques like the Wing
	Chun "immovable"<I> </I>elbow.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	It might be added that Siu Lim Tau's slow section also allows a pupil to
	practice mental clarity and Emptiness as described above. The mind should
	be like a mirror, reflecting all images and yet not stirred to restlessness.
	This promotes psychological simplicity--an important trait in the handling
	of complex situations. Beyond this, the cultivation of Mind or Awareness
	is also an essential quality of Siu Lim Tau practice. Siu Lim Tau's first
	section is often performed up to an hour in length. What an excellent opportunity
	for the mastery of this quality.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The second and third parts of Siu Lim Tau are executed at regular, normal
	speed. &nbsp;It has been suggested Siu Lim Tau's second section is similar
	to the Muscle Change Classic (I-Chin Ching). The entire set could be viewed
	as a type of yogic practice. &nbsp;But Siu Lim Tau mainly introduces principles
	and techniques for self-defense. The fighter learns to release power at the
	completion of each motion. "Each movement must be clear and crisp." The
	techniques are sharp, direct, and designed to maintain control of the centerline.
	The fighter learns to move quickly and yet remain in a natural state of
	relaxation. This allows for a smooth, transitional flow from motion to motion.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	After the introduction of the Siu Lim Tau set, this form may be performed
	with Wing Chun's Single-leg stance (Duk Lop Ma). This mode of practice further
	develops balance, strength and introduces correct structure and fundamentals
	for Wing Chun kicking. &nbsp;This type of training may be delayed until the
	Single-leg stance is introduced and mastered. &nbsp;Both of these methods,
	Regular and Single-leg Siu Lim Tau, have certain purposes unique to it.
	Practicing Siu Lim Tau set in either way develops a strong, balanced and
	potentially mobile stance.

	  </FONT></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT face="Lucida Handwriting">THE
	  CENTERLINE</FONT></FONT>
	</H4>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT face="Times New Roman" SIZE="+0"> The centerline principle is dominant
	throughout Wing Chun Kuen and is presented in each training set beginning
	with Siu Lim Tau. &nbsp;In one way, the centerline refers to the vertical
	plane which extends from the middle-front of the fighter. This imaginary<I>
	</I>line (or plane) originates from the "vertical axis-line" of the body.
	&nbsp;In a practical sense the centerline refers to the line or plane which
	exists between two fighters. &nbsp;This suggests the closest line for attack
	and defense. Obviously, this centerline is later distinguished from the
	"middle-front" or central line of the body.</FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In Siu Lim Tau, the centerline divides the body into left and right halves.
	At chest level, a horizontal line divides the upper body high and low. Since
	both hands are utilized in self-defense, the centerline concept assists the
	fighter in applying logical deflection or defense. Strikes approaching from
	the left are parried left; those from the right are deflected right. The
	centerline principle can also be applied high and low. This corresponds to
	the Wing Chun "four-gate theory," which permits a fighter to employ both
	hands equally to control and overcome an opponent.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	According to Wing Chun theory, offense is the best defense. "The closest
	distance between two points is a straight line." &nbsp;Wing Chun's rapid-fire
	punches are based on this practical idea. &nbsp;As noted, understanding the
	centerline also teaches the fighter to regain and protect his position. The
	object of this approach is to form a "triangular zone" of defense around
	the centerline. This is clearly demonstrated in Wing Chun's main On-Guard
	fighting position (Jon Sau). Using this principle, one may easily deflect
	many kinds of strikes. &nbsp;Wing Chun triangles are also important for
	penetrating the defense of an opponent. &nbsp;Simply put, practice and alertness
	of the centerline assists in logical, effective martial tactics.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Siu Lim Tau is a fascinating form and each of its 108 movements reward the
	pupil with numerous concepts and techniques. &nbsp;Siu Lim Tau practice mainly
	represents the idea of complete simplicity. When applied, Siu Lim Tau movements
	should be direct and efficient. This principle is responsible for the economical
	and practical skills that permits a fighter to reach a high level of
	accomplishment. In accordance with the Shaolin tradition, Siu Lim Tau set
	also offers the disciple complete and balanced training. &nbsp;Siu Lim Tau
	prepares one for an arduous journey, one that is as difficult as it is to
	be simple!
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Siu Lim Tau training promotes key fundamental principles in Wing Chun Kuen:
	It acquaints one with Wing Chun's structural foundation--the pyramid. This
	encourages centering and sinking skills. It introduces the centerline concept
	and demonstrates correct position and movement of the elbow. Siu Lim Tau
	set demands physical relaxation and mental clarity. Hence, a pupil is introduced
	to the concept of Awareness (Mind only). Siu Lim Tau also promotes Ch'i
	development through natural breathing, thus stimulating the circulation and
	function of various organs of the body. Siu Lim Tau is considered good, healthy
	exercise.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Siu Lim Tau set develops Wing Chun's three major family techniques known
	as Taan Sau, Bong Sau and Fok Sau. These skills serve as models for advanced
	hand techniques and exercises. As such, Siu Lim Tau preserves and introduces
	all the basic self-defense techniques used in this system. This implies that
	Siu Lim Tau set is prerequisite for training in Chum Kiu, Biu Jee and the
	Wooden Dummy because these skills are instrumental in the application of
	all Wing Chun techniques. &nbsp;Siu Lim Tau practice generates the foundation
	for all subsequent aspects of the fighting art.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Upon learning Wing Chun advanced sets, the fighter will automatically develop
	and refine Siu Lim Tau movements even more. &nbsp;Siu Lim Tau, Chum Kiu,
	and Biu Jee may even be practiced as one complete set, for Wing Chun's three
	hand forms are closely related. &nbsp;The result of this intrinsic, cyclic
	association is that Siu Lim Tau movements can be used to counter advanced
	skills such as circular techniques and Biu Jee emergency applications. Without
	a strong basis in Small Idea, it is difficult to advance to higher levels
	of Wing Chun training. This simple, practical form consolidates all the
	groundwork for the Wing Chun exponent. Truly, Siu Lim Tau is the right beginning.
