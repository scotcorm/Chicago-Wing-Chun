	</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+0">Wing Chun's second set is called Chum
	Kiu which means "Searching for the Bridge." The word Chum means Searching;
	Kiu is a Bridge or Forearm. Chum Kiu indicates a search for an opponent.
	This implies closing the distance, sticking and controlling an adversary
	in combat. As a technique, Chum Kiu may also refer to Sinking the Bridge.
	This indicates a sudden dropping of the arm-bridge and is an important technique.
	However, to translate Chum Kiu set in this manner is said to be inappropriate.
	Chum Kiu is associated with the idea of searching, chasing and closing the
	gap. Basic mobility plays a significant role in this set. "Where is the
	opponent's bridge to be found? Chum Kiu guides the way."</FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The term Chum Kiu, like Siu Lim Tau, can be understood in different ways.
	Chum Kiu points to a spontaneous act of seeking out what is essential.
	&nbsp;This reveals a direct and immediate action--whether physical, mental
	or spiritual. In self-defense, this indicates the opponent and the control
	of his defensive capability. &nbsp;Searching for the Bridge represents a
	sudden response that is directed toward the defeat of an adversary. &nbsp;This
	promotes a&nbsp;focused intent and aligns the totality of one's being. &nbsp;A
	direct and positive attitude are crucial in the world of martial arts. This
	mindset, perhaps more than anything else, encourages the highest degree of
	skill and success in combat. Chum Kiu develops non-hesitation and a unified
	purpose in Wing Chun Kuen.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The concept of Chum Kiu may also be understood in a metaphysical sense. Searching
	for the Bridge (Chum Kiu) indicates a clear aim and therefore a potential
	discovery and realization. &nbsp;The bridge in ancient religions always signified
	the Way leading to truth and reality. This is the way of the Buddha, Tao
	or Christ: &nbsp;"I am the way," meaning not one's ordinary self, but what
	is really meant by "I." This directs one past the ego toward the development
	of true Individuality. &nbsp;When the bridge is discovered and crossed, the
	aspirant is lead to the other shore. A Buddhist mantra chants, "O Wisdom
	which has gone, gone, gone to the other shore, gone beyond the other
	shore--Svaha!"

	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+0">Chum Kiu presents second level in
	Wing Chun Kuen and is therefore a practical combat stage. Through the mastery
	of Chum Kiu and Sticky Hands training one approaches real self-defense
	application. As a preliminary level, Siu Lim Tau is an important beginning
	but is not considered practical, <I>per se</I>. The techniques acquired from
	statonary Siu Lim Tau practice must be incorporated with effective footwork
	and elements from Wing Chun's advanced sets to be rendered truly
	effective.</FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Wing Chun training sets are extremely multipurposed. They introduce essential
	techniques and skills as well as individual levels of development.<I> </I>These
	unique sets represent important clues that unlock the progressive, deeper
	aspects of the fighting art. &nbsp;For instance, Chum Kiu training points
	to a dynamic and practical level in Wing Chun Kuen. "Chum Kiu trains the
	stance and the waist, The arm-bridge is short and the steps are narrow."
	"A quick fight should be ended quickly, No delay can be allowed." &nbsp;This
	indicates some of the general ideas and fighting concepts associated with
	this training form.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Due to many deflecting and controlling skills presented, Chum Kiu set is
	often described as a fundamental, defensive form. Yet Chum Kiu set displays
	harmony between offensive and defensive skills, both practical and developmental
	methods. Martial training sets introduce many skills and physical elements
	that may appear impractical. &nbsp;In Wing Chun Kuen, Chum Kiu level represents
	an initial fighting stage. &nbsp;The set introduces neither fancy moves or
	advanced forms of mobility. Chum Kiu presents basic principles that enhance
	balance, body unity, torque and improved structure. &nbsp;It encourages simple,
	effective boxing techniques. &nbsp;Searching for the Bridge and general
	in-fighting concepts remain a practical concern.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<IMG SRC="yip2.jpg" WIDTH="120" HEIGHT="210" ALIGN="Left">One subject further
	developed in Chum Kiu practice is Posture or Facing. This style is known
	as Front Body or Jing Sun Wing Chun. The term Front Body refers to close-fighting
	tactics and indicates that the hands are used in a forward manner. The Basic
	Posture (Yee Jee Kim Yeung Ma), which is used in forms and exercises, is
	considered fundamental. The idea that both hands must be equal and always
	able to touch an opponent is not absolute. Wing Chun's Forward Leg stance
	(Ding Sip Ma) and neutral or Side Body posture (Juk Sun Ma) are both used
	within the Jing Sun concept. Hence, Jing Sun Wing Chun includes the element
	of Juk Sun (Side Body). These principles are harmonized and hence this fighting
	art is also known as Slant Body Wing Chun.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Associated with the idea of Facing and Shifting is the development of Wing
	Chun's pyramid theory. In Chum Kiu, structural elements take on a new dynamic
	dimension. With greater movement, the basic pyramid structure is transformed
	into a spinning cone of force. This includes interlocking structural pyramids
	as well. "Turning the stance with a circular movement, Will allow superior
	generation of power." In Chum Kiu set, the pyramid concept evolves and symbolizes
	structural transition and energy in motion. Pyramid power and the theory
	of cones are some of the numerous secrets behind the efficiency of Wing Chun
	Kuen.

	  SECTIONS</FONT></FONT>
	</H4>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+0"> Chum Kiu set contains 108 movements.
	The form is divided into three sections with each presenting a unique topic
	of study. Chum Kiu set introduces three new stances: Chor Ma (Turning Stance),
	Tor Ma (Chasing Stance) and Toi Ma (Backward Stance). Turning and Chasing
	Stances dominate Chum Kiu set thus presenting body unity with mobil fighting
	concepts. In connection with some basic stances, hand and bridge techniques
	are also introduced. These include the Turning Elbows (Chor Ma Pai Jong),
	Turning Lon Sau/Bong Sau, and Stepping Low Bong Sau. Chum Kiu set also introduces
	basic kicking techniques and therefore an equal development of hand and leg
	skills.</FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Chum Kiu's first section introduces Wing Chun's popular Turning Stance (Chor
	Ma). Turning or "sitting" stance is a root movement in Wing Chun that encourages
	centering and torquing skills. This is accomplished through the concise shifting
	of the body. Wing Chun Turning is applied with a subtle, focused weight change.
	When properly taught, this movement teaches a pupil to generate great power
	instantly by spinning on a central-axis. In its simplicity, Turning Stance
	demonstrates the economy of movement and advanced structural design behind
	Wing Chun theory and application.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	While body torque is fundamental to all the martial arts, Wing Chun's advanced
	method of Shifting sets it apart from various styles. For example, Turning
	Elbows (Chor Ma Pai Jong) are executed by spinning the upper body 180 degrees,
	while the lower turns 90. This not only develops body torque, but defines
	it! Turning Stance and weight shifting encourages the acquisition of body
	unity and is prerequisite in the use of footwork. In Wing Chun Kuen, body
	unity refers to an alignment of the upper and lower frames. Body unity and
	torque ability promote solidity and coordination in action. This fighting
	skill enhances striking and defensive techniques through efficient structural
	cooperation.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The second and third sections of Chum Kiu set present Wing Chun's Chasing
	Stance (Tor Ma). Tor Ma is a darting, Step/Slide movement, and is introduced
	in a linear and lateral manner. Unlike Turning Stance, Tor Ma is a type of
	footwork. When applying Tor Ma, the toes are kept parallel. The exponent
	steps with the front foot and slides the rear. The front leg, which remains
	lighter than the back, allows fast and continuous forward advancing. When
	executing Tor Ma (and Chor Ma) the weight distribution returns to 60/40,
	with 60 percent on the rear leg. This braces the body and encourages centering
	skills.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Stepping, double Bong Sau is one of Chum Kiu's most significant techniques.
	Repeated three times in the third section, this skill develops correct timing
	and coordination between hands and legs. The Stepping (Low) Wing Block (Bong
	Sau) begins with the front step and is completed before the rear foot slides
	forward. In drills, Stepping Bong Sau can be substituted with punching and
	applied with similar timing. &nbsp;Later, one can execute punches with both
	a forward step and a rear slide--using the drop step and rear push of the
	leg. This allows one to execute rapid punches with the whole body, not just
	the arm.
	<H4 ALIGN=Center>

	</H4>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A popular drill associated with Chum Kiu level is Chor Ma Chay Kuen (Turning
	Punches). &nbsp;Like straight punching, the focus remains the centerline.
	Turning encourages the development of applied force. &nbsp;Following the
	Double Spear Hand, the <FONT COLOR="#000000">Wing Chun Turning Elbows (Chor
	Ma Pai Jong) encourage balance, centering skills and power. Initially, the
	Pai Jong movement is applied by pulling the hands inward while turning. This
	is similar to a diver who pulls his arms in upon executing a twist. When
	applying full Turning and Hacking Elbows, the upper body turns through 180
	degrees, the lower body and feet turn 90 degrees. This promotes a vital "two
	to one" ratio in upper/lower body movement. &nbsp;</FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	In a similiar manner, Chor Ma Bong Sau/Lon Sau (Turning Wing Block/Bar Arm)
	also presents a near "two to one" ratio in body movement. &nbsp;The upper
	body turns 135 degrees, while the (Wing) arm and feet turns 90. To perform
	Turning Bong Sau (Wing Block) correctly, the wrist should stop on the centerline.
	Body torque is generated and directed toward the front. A torque movement
	should be concentrated and released near the beginning, not the end, of a
	motion. The wrist should be focused upon the centerline. &nbsp;
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The second section in Chum Kiu begins with Lon Sau (Bar Arm) and a Front
	Kick, followed by Tor Ma Bong Sau (Step/Slide Wing Block). &nbsp; The Lon
	Sau is designed to disrupt the opponent and provide room for landing a Front
	Kick. &nbsp;As noted, Tor Ma Bong Sau (Stepping Wing Block) teaches correct
	body timing and aggressive power. &nbsp;Bong Sau is executed with the front
	step and is completed before the rear foot terminates. &nbsp;This braces
	the body and adds force to the movement. In Chum Kiu, many aggressive movements
	are introduced with defensive hand skills, thus obscuring the true intent
	of future usage. &nbsp;For instance, angular footwork can be successfully
	combined with hand skills and striking methods. In application, the Bong
	Sau is usually applied in a forward or jamming manner.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	A subtle yet practical movement introduced in Chum Kiu is the concise Half-turn.
	The meaning of this movement is extremely important and is often overlooked
	by many Wing Chun exponents. &nbsp;In Chum Kiu set, Full-turning is usually
	expressed, but the Half-turn is also realized. Half-turning is discovered
	in all sections of Chum Kiu. In most cases, as introduced in Chum Kiu, the
	Half-turn also promotes a "two to one" ratio in body movement. The upper
	body moves 90 degrees while the lower body turns 45. In Wing Chun Kuen, even
	in smaller motions, body torque and explosive power is cultivated.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Linear Chasing Stance (Tor Ma) is presented in Chum Kiu's Tor Ma Sarng Dai
	Bong Sau. In this sequence, Wing Blocks are performed low to sink the shoulders
	and weight. This advancing movement combines <I> </I>a forward chasing<I>
	</I>step with bridge techniques. One searches with both hand and leg. As
	an alternate drill, a type of linear, direct Stepping (Tor Ma) can be combined
	with Punching techniques. The execution of punches with both step and slide
	can be explored. Chasing/attacking maneuvers are considered superior self-defense
	techniques. Angling or side-stepping can be employed to supplement one's
	fighting strategy.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Finally, Chum Kiu training also introduces various kicking skills or Leg
	maneuvers. Section three begins with a Turning Stance and skip Front Kick.
	This may be followed by the right and left Side Kick. &nbsp;Completing the
	section, in most Wing Chun traditions, is a Slant Front Kick. &nbsp;This
	is immediately followed by Turning blocks (Gum Sau) and consecutive punching
	skills. These final techniques develop body torque, hand flow, continuity,
	punching and blocking ability. &nbsp;This encourages sound boxing structure,
	stability and power.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	<FONT COLOR="#004080"><U><I> </I></U></FONT>All
	<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="+0">Chum Kiu techniques are designed to
	be practical in self-defense applications. &nbsp;Some movements are worthy
	of special attention. Any technique repeated three times should be drilled
	extensively. Techniques such as Chor Ma Pai Jong (Hacking Elbows), Turning
	Lon Sau/Bong Sau and Tor Ma Bong Sau (Stepping Bong Sau), present vital martial
	concepts. Techniques delivered in a Forward Posture (Ding Sip Ma) should
	be carefully noted. A Forward position introduces the main Wing Chun Pre-fighting
	Stance. Hand techniques such as the Jip Sau (Arm Catching), Straight Palms
	(Jing Jeong) and the Wing Chun Uppercut describe flowing skills in an active
	fighting position.</FONT>
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	With the essential Chum Kiu ideas and techniques outlined, it may be apparent
	that in each of the three sections discussed, both hand and body continuity
	are fully expressed. Body Unity is known to be an important skill associated
	with Chum Kiu training. One might say Chum Kiu set and its unique movements
	are carefully divided between developmental and practical methods. Front
	and Side Body postures are equally used and coordinated. This harmonious
	consideration cultivates both force and practical fighting ability.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Chum Kiu set contains many qualities which lead a fighter toward a progressive,
	total development. Within Wing Chun training, opposites are introduced and
	eventually balanced. Only then can the exponent truly progress. In Chum Kiu
	practice, one begins to physically understand and use the Yin-Yang concept.
	In a psychological sense, it is through fluctuation that one recognizes and
	approaches unity and the path between extremes. The Middle Way and Doctrine
	of the Mean are extremely suggestive. This central doctrine allows one to
	avoid many pitfalls and indicates the razor's edge between the opinions and
	methods of other systems.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	The principle aim of Chum Kiu practice remains self-defense. "Use the three
	joints of the arm to prevent entry by the opponent's bridge. Jam the opponent's
	bridge to restrict his movement." The three joints indicate the division
	of the arm employed for defense--the wrist, elbow and shoulder. The opponent
	is restricted in a similar manner: &nbsp;"The three joints are nicely
	controlled." Indeed, the fighter may, "Create a bridge if the opponent's
	bridge is not present." Or, "Use the arm-bridge to track the movement of
	the opponent's body." Chum Kiu deals with basic fighting tactics. In Wing
	Chun Kuen this suggests searching for, controlling and finishing the opponent.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Chum Kiu relates to self-defense but certain maxims do hint at internal training
	in Wing Chun. "The eyes are trained to be alert, The Ch'i flows in perpetual
	motion." This signifies an aware martial quality; the flow of Ch'i refers
	to the development and purification of the complete Man. "Strive to remain
	calm in the midst of motion; Loosen up the muscles and relax the mind." To
	relax the mind and remain calm can be understood physically, but these concepts
	indicate the creation of a spiritual center in everyday life. With this ability,
	the disciple can strive to be a master of a situation and not its slave.
	<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
	Wing Chun's Siu Lim Tau (Small Idea) symbolizes a humble birth and small
	beginning. Chum Kiu receives this creation and places it in motion. Like
	a child taking his first step, Small Idea may falter with initial movement.
	However, with work this essential beginning matures and is restored to its
	original purity. Siu Lim Tau represents the right start, but Chum Kiu directs
	the pupil to an important goal: balance and Unity! Within Chum Kiu training
	and in the midst of motion, one affirms "I am." But one may question, "Where
	do I go from here?" The answer echoes back, "Chum Kiu guides the way."
