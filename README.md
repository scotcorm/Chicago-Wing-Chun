# About
This site was created soon after I recieved my MLIS, and before I started studying front end development, so it is heavy in HTML. My Wing Chun group in Chicago needed a site and so I created this one.  In doing so I was able to bring in an HTML site that had already been built, and some great information from my teacher Ken Harnish.  I also created some new images for the site logo, and gaind experience working with an interesting gallery tool.
